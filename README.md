  5. If you did eveything correctly, and you left click on the testclass.java file, and select "Run as", you should see "JUnit Test" as an option. Click on that, and the testing should begin.
  
# Known issues
 - Geckodriver at times like to bug out, and when the testcases reaches it's end, instead of just closing the browser it crashes out of it. However this does not have any effect on the testcases themselves.
 - Selenium likes to hang on when it can't find an element on a page. This issue have been resolved and checked in the testcases, so it shouldn't case any trouble.
 - Geckodriver sometimes fails to close, so it can stay open as a background process. This issue have been handled by me in the @After period of the testcases.
